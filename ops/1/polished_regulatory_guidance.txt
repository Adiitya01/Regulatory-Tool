**Thermal Requirements**
Effluent gas from the ethylene oxide sterilization process shall be discharged through an EO gas treatment system, such as a catalytic oxidizer, wet acid scrubber or thermal oxidizer, in compliance with local permit requirements or emission control legislation. When choosing a diluent, consideration should be given to its ozone depleting potential and disposal of any by-products.
**Heat Requirements**
Products shall be designed to allow removal of air, if applicable, and penetration of heat, humidity and ethylene oxide during the sterilization process, and removal of ethylene oxide at the end of the process. Packaging shall also be designed to meet these requirements.
The load configuration shall ensure that products are exposed to a uniform distribution of heat, humidity and ethylene oxide throughout the sterilization cycle.
**Validation Requirements**
When introducing new or modified products into an existing ethylene oxide sterilization process, a validation study shall be performed to demonstrate equivalence. This includes:
- Comparison with the validated product and/or Process Control Document (PCD) used to validate the existing EO process.
- Examination of factors that could affect the initial bioburden on the product, including manufacturing facilities, raw materials, sources of these materials and production processes.
The validation study shall include evidence or assessment of the bioburden of the product and its resistance relative to the internal PCD. A documented conclusion shall be made that the new or modified product is suitable for adoption into the product family/processing category specifically referenced in the current validation study, achieving the specified Sterilization Assurance Level (SAL).
**Documentation Requirements**
The following documentation shall be maintained:
- Evidence of validation studies performed on products and equipment.

The following guidance outlines the product requirements for compliance with ISO 11135.
**Product Definition**
The manufacturer of the device shall document the results of product definition, which includes establishing the sterilization process applicable for the defined product. This involves:
* Establishing a process specification that can be applied for the sterilization of the defined product during validation studies (Clause 8).
* Defining the sterilization process applicable for the defined product, including new or modified products, packaging, or loading configurations (Clause 8.2).
**Process Definition**
The purpose of process definition is to obtain a process specification that can be applied for the sterilization of the defined product during validation studies (Clause 8). This involves:
* Performing process definition activities in a sterilization chamber (developmental chamber or production chamber) (Clause 8.3).
* Establishing the sterilization process applicable for the defined product, including new or modified products, packaging, or loading configurations (Clause 8.2).
**Validation**
The purpose of validation is to demonstrate that the sterilization process established in the process definition can be delivered effectively and reproducibly to the product within the sterilization load (Clause 9). Validation consists of a number of identified stages:
* Process qualification: demonstrating that the specified sterilization process is effective in sterilizing the most difficult-to-sterilize location within the product (Clause 7.1.6).

## 🔹 **Biological Indicator Compliance Requirements**

**Biological Indicator Requirements for Ethylene Oxide Sterilization (ISO 11135)**
**Introduction**
The use of Biological Indicators (BIs) is a critical component of the ethylene oxide sterilization process. BIs are used to verify the effectiveness of the sterilization process and ensure that products are free from viable microorganisms. This guidance outlines the requirements for BIs as specified in ISO 11135.
**Temperature Monitoring**
Temperature monitoring is essential to ensure that the sterilization process is effective. According to Annex C (informative) of ISO 11135, it is recommended to use one temperature sensor per 2.5 m³ during Operational Qualification (OQ) to establish a thermal map of the room or chamber. This will help identify potential hot or cold locations and ensure that monitoring includes more than one plane.
**Relative Humidity (RH) Monitoring**
RH monitoring is also critical to ensure that the sterilization process is effective. According to ISO 11135, RH meters must be in conformance with the specifications established during validation for the specific product(s) in a defined load. Parametric release is based upon a documented review of processing records rather than the testing of biological indicators or Process Control Devices (PCDs). The values and tolerances for both RH and EO concentration may need to be generated after review of a predefined number of routine cycles.
**Biological Indicator Requirements**
BIs must comply with the requirements specified in ISO 11135. BIs are used as part of the routine monitoring and control of loads processed, and their use is justified and recorded. The rationale for the number of runs selected should be documented.
**Chemical Indicators**
Chemical indicators shall not replace biological indicators for product release or be used to support a rationale to release a load parametrically. If parametric release is performed, additional data must be recorded and retained, including:
* Temperature in the chamber from a minimum of two locations throughout the sterilization cycle
* Chamber humidity during conditioning as determined by direct measurement
* EO concentration, determined from direct analysis of chamber atmosphere using analytical methods at defined intervals sufficient to ensure that allowable product EO residuals are met.
**Validation and Requalification**
The validation process must include the deposit of microorganisms for the purposes of patent and regulation. The reference microorganism microbial strain obtained from a recognized culture collection is used in the validation process. Requalification is necessary to confirm the continued acceptability of a specified process, and it should be performed at least annually.
**Importance of Compliance**
Compliance with Biological Indicator requirements is essential to ensure that products are free from viable microorganisms. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in product contamination and compromise patient safety.
**Audit-Ready Checklist**
To ensure compliance with Biological Indicator requirements, the following audit-ready checklist should be used:
* Temperature monitoring: Are temperature sensors used per 2.5 m³ during OQ?
* RH monitoring: Are RH meters in conformance with specifications established during validation?
* BI usage: Are BIs used as part of routine monitoring and control of loads processed?
* Chemical indicators: Are chemical indicators not used to replace biological indicators for product release or support parametric release?
* Additional data recording: Is additional data recorded and retained, including temperature, chamber humidity, and EO concentration?
By following this guidance and using the audit-ready checklist, organizations can ensure compliance with Biological Indicator requirements and maintain the effectiveness of their ethylene oxide sterilization process.
**Biological Indicator Requirements for Ethylene Oxide Sterilization**
The use of a Biological Indicator (BI) is a critical component in ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of an ethylene oxide sterilization process. This document outlines the requirements for the validation, qualification, and control of biological indicators as specified in ISO 11135.
**Validation Requirements**
1. **Requalification Program**: The requalification program shall be conducted annually to ensure that inadvertent process changes have not occurred and to demonstrate that the original validation remains valid.
2. **Acceptable Ranges and Levels of Variability**: The requalification program should define acceptable ranges and levels of variability in performance that are necessary to maintain the validity of the original validation from year to year.
3. **Investigation of Non-Conformity**: In the event of a non-conformity, an investigation shall be initiated to try to determine the root cause(s) of the non-conformity and its impact on the validity of the requalification program.
**Process Qualification (PQ)**
1. **Biological Indicators Used in PQ**: Biological indicators used in PQ shall comply with the applicable clauses of ISO 11138-1:2006.
2. **Chemical Indicators**: Chemical indicators used as part of PQ shall comply with ISO 11140-1 and be used in conjunction with microbiological and physical monitoring.
**Validation Report**
1. **Preparation of Validation Report**: A validation report shall be prepared, including results from incubation of biological indicators.
2. **Review and Approval**: The validation report shall be reviewed and approved by the designated responsible person(s).
3. **Content of Validation Report**: The validation report shall describe or reference specific qualified product, defined load configurations, and the documented specification for the EO sterilization process.
**Release of Product**
1. **Use of Saleable Product in Validation Studies**: If saleable product is used in validation studies, the requirements for release of this product for distribution shall be generated before the start of the validation activities.
2. **Effect on Product and Packaging Functionality**: The effect of repeated exposures to the validation/sterilization processes on product and packaging functionality, and levels of residual ethylene oxide, shall be assessed.
**Training and Competence**
1. **Personnel Training**: Each organization shall establish procedures for identifying training needs and ensure that all personnel are trained to adequately perform their assigned responsibilities.
2. **Management Responsibility**: The management system shall include quality policy, planning, responsibility, authority, and communication, and management review.
**Qualification Requirements**
1. **Product Conformance Criteria**: Product shall be considered as non-conforming and handled in accordance with the applicable clauses of ISO 13485 if one or more of the conformance criteria are not fulfilled.
2. **Investigation of Non-Conformity**: In the event of a positive BI, it is not acceptable to release product based on acceptable results of a product test for sterility.
**Biological Indicator Incubation**
1. **Establishment of Conditions**: The conditions used for recovery of biological indicators in qualification studies, including duration of incubation, shall be established and documented.
2. **Incubation Period**: The incubation period shall take into account the possibility of delayed outgrowth of spores that have been exposed to EO.
**Compliance Importance**
The use of a Biological Indicator is critical in ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of an ethylene oxide sterilization process. Compliance with these requirements is essential to ensure patient safety and prevent harm from contaminated medical devices.
**Audit-Ready Guidance**
This document provides comprehensive guidance on the biological indicator requirements for ethylene oxide sterilization, as specified in ISO 11135. It is intended to be used by organizations implementing an ethylene oxide sterilization process and provides a framework for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
The use of biological indicators (BIs) is a critical component of ethylene oxide sterilization processes. BIs serve as a means to validate the effectiveness of the sterilization process and ensure that products are rendered free from viable microorganisms. This guidance outlines the requirements for the qualification, validation, and operation of BIs in accordance with ISO 11135.
**Qualification of Biological Indicators**
1. **Routine Processing Parameters**: The routine processing parameters that deliver a minimum of 12 Spore Log Reduction (SLR) of the biological indicator shall be established using one of the methods described in A.1.3.
2. **Number of Cycles**: The number of cycles required for qualification is dictated by the method used.
3. **Recovery Conditions**: The conditions used for recovery of BIs in qualification studies shall be established and documented, taking into account the possibility of delayed outgrowth of spores that have been exposed to EO.
4. **Incubation Period**: The incubation period shall be determined based on the guidance provided in ISO 14161.
**Qualification Following Significant Changes**
1. **Significant Changes**: In circumstances where a significant change has occurred, such as changes to product/packaging design or configuration (creating a new "worst-case" condition), process design or equipment/service, qualification of BIs shall be repeated.
2. **Professional Judgment**: In the absence of physical or microbiological qualification requirements, professional judgment can be used where no changes have been made to product, packaging, equipment/services and process, acceptable chamber performance and engineering review, and the routine sterilization process has operated reliably in the intervening period.
1. **Observations of Growth**: Observations of growth from BIs not attributable to failure to meet physical process specifications shall be analyzed; this can lead to a need for process or equipment modifications, and for the PQ to be repeated.
2. **Healthcare Facility Applications**: In healthcare facility applications, external chemical indicators in health care facilities: sterilizer indicator tape, an indicating label or an indicating printed legend should be affixed to or printed on each package assembled by the manufacturer.
**Validation**

**Biological Indicators for Ethylene Oxide Sterilization - Compliance Guidance**
The use of biological indicators (BIs) is a critical component in ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of ethylene oxide (EO) sterilization processes. As specified in ISO 11135, BIs are used to validate the sterility assurance level (SAL) of medical devices processed using EO. This guidance provides an overview of the requirements for Biological Indicators as per ISO 11135, emphasizing their importance and compliance significance.
According to ISO 11135, a BI sample set exposed at zero time should be subjected to all stages of the experimental cycle prior to sterilant injection (D.14.1.3). The incubation period for BIs is provided in ISO 14161:2009, Section 12.3 (D.14.1.4).
To demonstrate the appropriateness of a BI relative to bioburden inactivation time, a test of sterility can be performed either before or during process definition using a fractional-cycle of the appropriate exposure time (D.14.2). This ensures that the BI is suitable for validating the SAL of medical devices processed using EO.
**Microbial Strains and Culture Collections**
For the purpose of validation, microbial strains must be obtained from recognized culture collections, as defined in ISO/TS 11139:2006 (Definitions 2.38-2.40). These collections provide a standardized source for microorganisms used in BI development and testing.
**Sterilization Validation Process**
A sterilization validated process is essential to render medical devices free from viable microorganisms (3.47). The nature of microbial inactivation is exponential, and thus the survival of a microorganism on an individual item can be expressed in terms of probability (Note 1 to entry).
**Probability of Microbial Survival**
The probability of microbial survival can never be reduced to zero, even with a very low number (3.46). Therefore, it is essential to understand that a SAL of 10-6 provides greater assurance of sterility than an SAL of 10-3.
**Material Effects and EO Compositions**
EO has been comprehensively documented in literature, providing knowledge on the manner in which process variables affect microbial inactivation (5.4). However, reference to these general studies is not required by this International Standard.
The effects of EO on a wide variety of materials used to manufacture medical devices have also been extensively documented and are valuable for those designing and developing medical devices that will be processed using EO.
**Developmental Chamber Studies**
When using a developmental chamber for process definition, consideration should be given to establishing the relationship between data from developmental chamber studies and production chamber data (D.9.4.2.4). This is particularly important when developing microbial inactivation curves, which may not always be possible in production chambers due to size constraints and injection/removal times.
**Product Families and Processing Categories**
Medical devices can be grouped into product families based on commonality within a processing category (e.g., intravenous sets and syringes). All products within this category should present an equivalent or lesser challenge to the sterilization process compared with the worst-case product, representative member, or internal PCD.
The use of BIs is critical in ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements for EO sterilization. Failure to meet these requirements can result in non-compliance and potential risks to patient safety.
This guidance provides a comprehensive overview of the Biological Indicator requirements as per ISO 11135, emphasizing their importance and compliance significance. It serves as an audit-ready resource for organizations seeking to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements for EO sterilization.
By following this guidance, medical device manufacturers can ensure that their BIs are suitable for validating the SAL of medical devices processed using EO, thereby ensuring patient safety and regulatory compliance.
The use of a Biological Indicator (BI) is essential in ethylene oxide sterilization processes to ensure that the product has been effectively sterilized. This document outlines the requirements and guidelines for the implementation of BIs in accordance with ISO 11135.
**Qualification and Validation**
11.1 **Conformance Criteria**: The BI shall be qualified before use in a sterilization process. This qualification involves demonstrating that the BI is capable of detecting the lethality of the sterilization cycle.
11.2 **Non-Conforming Product**: If one or more conformance criteria are not fulfilled, the product shall be considered non-conforming and handled in accordance with applicable clauses of ISO 13485.
**BI Requirements**
12.1 **Consistency over Time**: The BI used for validation studies shall be consistent over time, and its resistance to bioburden shall be shown to be equal to or less resistant than the resistance of the biological indicator.
12.2 **Resistance Demonstration**: The resistance of the internal Process Control Device (PCD) shall be demonstrated by running the sterilization cycle at graded exposure times or exposing graded BI populations to a single sterilization exposure time, followed by determination of the lethal rate through D-value calculations.
**BI/PCD Selection**
13.1 **Selection Criteria**: The selection of BIs and PCDs for use in ethylene oxide sterilization shall depend on:
a) Microbiological qualification method chosen (see Annex A or Annex B);
b) Product volume;
c) Type of chamber (developmental vs. production).
**Approach 1: Fractional Cycle**
14.1 **Fractional Cycle**: In this approach, a test of sterility of the product and PCD is performed following a fractional cycle. The results of this study shall provide a means of lethality comparison using survival data from the tests of sterility for the product and PCD.
**Approach 2: Direct Enumeration**
15.1 **Direct Enumeration**: In cases where an indication exists that sufficient bioburden data are available, direct enumeration methods and/or fraction-negative methods (see ISO 14161) can be used to demonstrate the lethality challenge of the bioburden and PCD.
**Approach 3: Fractional Cycle with Direct Enumeration**
16.1 **Fractional Cycle with Direct Enumeration**: This approach can be applied in cases where:
a) The product bioburden challenge is equal to or greater than the challenge of the BI within the PCD;
b) The product bioburden contains highly resistant microorganisms; or
c) A BI with a lower population than required by ISO 11138-2:2006, 9.3 is used in the PCD.
The use of BIs and PCDs in ethylene oxide sterilization processes is critical to ensure that products are effectively sterilized and meet regulatory requirements. Compliance with these guidelines is essential for maintaining a high level of sterility assurance level (SAL) and preventing product contamination.
To ensure compliance, the following audit-ready requirements shall be met:
* A qualified BI shall be used in each sterilization process.
* The resistance of the internal PCD shall be demonstrated through D-value calculations or direct enumeration methods.
* The lethality challenge of the bioburden and PCD shall be based on direct enumeration methods and/or fraction-negative methods (see ISO 14161).
* A fractional cycle test of sterility for the product and PCD shall be performed to demonstrate lethality comparison.
By following these guidelines, manufacturers can ensure that their ethylene oxide sterilization processes meet regulatory requirements and maintain a high level of sterility assurance level (SAL).
The determination of lethal rate of the sterilization process is a critical aspect of ethylene oxide (EO) sterilization. This compliance guidance focuses on the requirements for biological indicators (BIs) as specified in ISO 11135, providing clear and authoritative information to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
Biological indicators are used to validate the effectiveness of the EO sterilization process. They provide a means to determine the lethality challenge of the sterilization process and ensure that it delivers a Sterilization Assurance Level (SAL) of 10^-3 or less for all products.
**Requirements for Biological Indicators**
The following requirements apply to biological indicators used in EO sterilization:
1. **Sample Set Exposure**: The sample set exposed at zero time should be exposed to all stages of the experimental cycle prior to sterilant injection.
2. **Number of Biological Indicators/PCDs**: When using the Stumbo-Murphy-Cochran procedure and the Overkill Cycle Calculation approach, a minimum of 10 biological indicators (BIs)/product configurations devices (PCDs) is recommended.
3. **Lethality Challenge**: The lethality challenge of the external PCD should not be less than 20% of the lethality challenge of the internal PCD.

**Audit Readiness**
This guidance has been developed to ensure compliance with ISO 11135:2014+A1:2019. Regular audits shall be conducted to verify that the biological indicator program is operating effectively and in accordance with these requirements.
By following this guidance, organizations can ensure that their biological indicator programs are compliant with regulatory requirements and provide a high level of assurance that products have been sterilized effectively.
The use of a biological indicator is a critical component in ensuring the effectiveness and safety of ethylene oxide sterilization processes. This compliance guide outlines the requirements for biological indicators as specified in ISO 11135, providing essential information to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
**Monitoring Biological Indicators**
When monitoring biological indicators, it is essential to follow established procedures to prevent any potential risks associated with inadequate EO processing. If the results of the biological indicator suggest inadequate EO processing, the contents of the package should not be used. The complete unused package, including load identification and the chemical indicator, should be returned to the processing department for appropriate follow-up.
The results of physical monitoring, chemical indicators elsewhere in the load, and biological monitoring should be reviewed to reach a conclusion as to whether the entire load should be recalled or not. Records of this review should be retained. A single non-responsive or inconclusive indicator should not be considered evidence that the entire load is non-sterile.
**Control of Biological Indicators**
To ensure the safety, quality, and performance of products following sterilization, it is essential to verify that the product and its packaging meet specified requirements for sterilization using defined process parameters. Design control is a critical aspect addressed in ISO 14971. If multiple sterilization cycles are permitted, the effects of such processing on the product and its packaging should be evaluated.
The biological safety of products following exposure to the sterilization process shall be established in accordance with regulatory requirements. The accuracy and reliability of instrumentation used to control and monitor the sterilization process shall be verified periodically in accordance with documented procedures.
**Maintenance of Equipment**
Preventative maintenance is essential for ensuring the effectiveness of equipment used in ethylene oxide sterilization processes. Maintenance procedures should follow manufacturers' recommendations, and all personnel involved in maintenance activities should receive adequate training.
**Process Control and Validation**
The development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization process can involve multiple parties with separate responsibilities. It is essential to establish clear procedures outlining the roles and responsibilities of each party involved in the process. Process equivalence can be established through analysis of process data combined with microbiological evaluation.
Parametric release is an alternative approach to traditional biological indicator testing, where a sterilization process delivers a minimum of 12 Spore Log Reduction (SLR) to a biological indicator having a resistance equal to or greater than the product bioburden. This method does not include the use of biological indicators.
The proper implementation and maintenance of biological indicators are critical components in ensuring compliance with regulatory standards for ethylene oxide sterilization processes. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in non-sterile products, compromising patient safety and product efficacy.
To ensure audit-readiness, the following checklist should be completed:
1. Verify that biological indicators are used as specified in ISO 11135.
2. Ensure that monitoring procedures for biological indicators are established and followed.
3. Confirm that equipment maintenance is performed according to manufacturers' recommendations.

This document provides comprehensive guidelines on the requirements for BIs in accordance with ISO 11135, emphasizing the importance of compliance to maintain patient safety and device efficacy.
**Scope**
This guidance applies to all organizations involved in the manufacture, processing, and distribution of medical devices sterilized using ethylene oxide (EO). It covers the specific requirements for biological indicators used in EO sterilization processes.
1. **Definition**: A BI is a product that contains a known number of microorganisms, typically bacterial spores, which are used to monitor the effectiveness of an EO sterilization process.
2. **Selection and Validation**: BIs must be selected and validated in accordance with ISO 11135, taking into account the specific product(s) being sterilized, the defined load, and the EO concentration.
**EO Concentration**
1. **Conformance**: The EO concentration must be in conformance with the specifications established during validation for the specific product(s) in a defined load.
2. **Parametric Release**: Parametric release is based upon a documented review of processing records rather than the testing of biological indicators or process challenge devices (PCDs).
3. **Values and Tolerances**: The values and tolerances for both relative humidity (RH) and EO concentration may need to be generated after review of a predefined number of routine cycles.
1. **Routine Monitoring**: BIs may be used as part of the routine monitoring and control of loads processed during the evaluation period.
2. **Rationale and Record Keeping**: The rationale for the number of runs selected should be justified and recorded.
**Equilibration Time**
1. **Introduction**: It can be necessary to introduce an equilibration time at the start of the EO dwell phase of the cycle to allow the chamber concentration to stabilize as the EO gas is distributed throughout the chamber and penetrates into the void spaces in the load.
2. **Note**: An electronic sensor measures EO gas concentration at only one sample site, whereas the calculated EO gas concentration represents the mean EO gas concentration within the space (volume) available for EO gas molecules to reside.
Compliance with ISO 11135 is essential to ensure the effectiveness and safety of medical devices sterilized using ethylene oxide. Failure to comply may result in inadequate sterilization, compromising patient safety and device efficacy.

**Concentration**
The calculated EO gas concentration within the chamber shall be determined using a validated method, taking into account factors such as sensor dynamic performance characteristics, placement of the sensor, and potential stratification within the chamber. The calculated concentration represents the mean EO gas concentration within the space available for EO gas molecules to reside.
To ensure accurate measurement, an equilibration time may be necessary at the start of the EO dwell phase of the cycle to allow the chamber concentration to stabilize as the EO gas is distributed throughout the chamber and penetrates into void spaces in the load.
**Exposure Time**
The exposure time for BIs shall be determined using one or more of the following approaches:
a) **Half-cycle approach**: A total of three consecutive experiments resulting in total inactivation of the biological indicators (with a population of not less than 10^6 and, where appropriate, placed within a PCD) shall be performed to confirm the minimum exposure time. The specified exposure time for the sterilization process shall be at least double this minimum time.
b) **Fractional cycle approach**: A fractional cycle of short duration from which BI survivors can be recovered shall also be run to demonstrate the adequacy of the recovery technique for BIs exposed to EO gas.
**Duration**
The incubation period for recovering biological indicators in qualification studies, including duration of incubation, shall be established and documented. The incubation period shall take into account the possibility of delayed outgrowth of spores that have been exposed to EO.
Refer to ISO 14161 for additional information on biological indicator incubation times.
**Recovery Techniques**
After time-graded exposures, BIs shall be recovered using a validated method, taking into account factors such as packaging and removal of EO from the PCD. Guidance on this approach can be found in ISO 14161.
The use of Biological Indicators is critical for ensuring the effectiveness of ethylene oxide sterilization processes.

## 🔹 **Storage & Distribution Compliance Requirements**

**Storage and Distribution Requirements for Ethylene Oxide Sterilization**
**Compliance Importance:**
Proper storage and distribution of ethylene oxide sterilized products are critical to ensure their quality, safety, and efficacy. Non-compliance with these requirements can lead to product contamination, reduced shelf life, or even patient harm.
**Storage Requirements (D.12.5.11.3)**
The design of the candidate product should be carefully reviewed for any changes or differences that could present greater obstacles to ethylene oxide (EO) penetration than the existing product or packaging configuration device (PCD). This includes evaluating:
1. **Product Design Changes**: Longer lumens, added closures, increased number of mated surfaces, or higher product density may impact EO penetration.
2. **Original Product Functionality Testing**: Review the product design against original testing to ensure changes do not compromise product functionality.
**Qualification Requirements (D.12.5.11.3)**
To qualify a candidate product for ethylene oxide sterilization, the following conditions must be met:
1. **Representative Challenge Process**: The EO process used for qualification should constitute a representative challenge to the product and its packaging system.
2. **Documentation**: Address how the challenge process differs from the nominal process, and demonstrate that these parameters are acceptable for product acceptance.
3. **Product Qualification**: Evaluate the candidate product and its packaging to determine the effect on product EO residual levels.
**Spore Log Reduction (D.5.3)**
When using ethylene oxide gas mixtures with carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or other inert gas blends, consider the following:
1. **EO Molecular Diffusion Rates**: EO molecular diffusion rates into polymer materials can be affected by the volume percent of EO gas molecules within the sterilant.
2. **Storage Conditions and Shelf Life**: Store in accordance with the EO manufacturer's recommendations and all applicable regulations.
**Parametric Release (D.11)**
When using parametric release, consider the following:
1. **Mean EO Gas Concentration**: Values obtained by calculating the mean EO gas concentration can differ considerably from direct measured values due to factors such as:
	* Selective absorption and adsorption of EO in the load.
	* Volume taken up by the load.
	* Potential stratification within the chamber.
**Monitoring Requirements (D.11)**
To ensure compliance, implement routine monitoring and control measures:
1. **Physical Monitoring**: Regularly review physical cycle variables to verify they are within tolerances defined in the sterilization process documentation.
2. **Review and Approval of Validation**: Conduct regular reviews and approvals of validation documents to ensure ongoing compliance.
**Control Requirements (D.11)**
To maintain control over the sterilization process, implement:
1. **Routine Monitoring and Control**: Regularly review and document physical cycle variables to ensure they remain within tolerances.
2. **Product Release from Sterilization**: Confirm product release through a formal review of process documentation by a designated individual or automated process.
**Gas Concentration Requirements (D.11)**
When using ethylene oxide gas mixtures, consider the following:
By adhering to these storage, qualification, spore log reduction, parametric release, monitoring, control, and gas concentration requirements, you can ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of ethylene oxide sterilized products.
